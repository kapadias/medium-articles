    "### Evaluate Topic Model in Python: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous article, I introduced the concept of topic modeling and walked through the code for developing your first topic model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method in the python using sklearn implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pursuing on that understanding, in this article, I'll go a few steps deeper by outlining the framework to quantitatively evaluate topic models through the measure of topic coherence and share the code template in python using Gensim implementation to allow for end-to-end model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why evaluate topic models?\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://tinyurl.com/y3xznjwq)\n",
    "\n",
    "We know probabilistic topic models, such as LDA, are popular tools for analysis of the text, providing both a predictive and latent topic representation of the corpus. There is a longstanding assumption that the latent space discovered by these models is meaningful and useful, and evaluating such assumptions is challenging due to its unsupervised training process. There is a no-gold standard list of topics to compare against every corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is equally important to identify if a trained model is objectively good or bad, as well have an ability to compare different models/methods and to do so, we require an objective measure for the quality. Traditionally, and still for many practical applications, to evaluate if \"the correct thing\" has been learned about the corpus, we use implicit knowledge and \"eyeballing\" approaches. Ideally, we'd like to capture this information in a single metric that can be maximized, and compared. Let's take a look at roughly what approaches are commonly used for the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eye Balling Models**\n",
    "- Top N words\n",
    "- Topics / Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "- Capturing model semantics\n",
    "- Topics interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Judgements**\n",
    "- What is a topic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extrinsic Evaluation Metrics/Evaluation at task**\n",
    "- Is model good at performing predefined tasks, such as classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language is messy, ambiguous and full of subjective interpretation, and sometimes trying to cleanse ambiguity reduces the language to an unnatural form. Nevertheless, in this article, we'll explore more about topic coherence, and how we can use it to quantitatively justify the model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Topic Coherence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is often used as an example of an intrinsic evaluation measure. It comes from the language modeling community and aims to capture how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before. It is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focussing on the log-likelihood part, you can think of the perplexity metric as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. That is to say, how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, past research has shown that predictive likelihood (or equivalently, perplexity) and human judgment are often not correlated, and even sometimes slightly anti-correlated. And that served as a motivation for more work trying to model the human judgment, and thus `Topic Coherence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic coherence concept combines a number of papers into one framework that allows evaluating the coherence of topics inferred by a topic model. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is topic coherence?\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is coherence?\n",
    "A set of statements or facts is said to be coherent, if they support each other. Thus, a coherent fact set can be interpreted in a context that covers all or most of the facts. An example of a coherent fact set is \"the game is a team sport\", \"the game is played with a ball\", \"the game demands great physical efforts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherence Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `C_v` measure is based on a sliding window, one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity\n",
    "2. `C_p` is based on a sliding window, one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelson's coherence\n",
    "3. `C_uci` measure is based on a sliding window and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the given top words\n",
    "4. `C_umass` is based on document cooccurrence counts, a one-preceding segmentation and a logarithmic conditional probability as confirmation measure\n",
    "5. `C_npmi` is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI)\n",
    "6. `C_a` is baseed on a context window, a pairwise comparison of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity"
